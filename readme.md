## What?
My friend Mack is learning c++ and he wanted me to host his first project on Github.

## Building
Install g++ and make and y'know all that good stuff.
Currently designed to be built for Windows but its cpp you can change it pretty easy.
```sh
make
```

## Usage
It just spits out an executable on build.
```sh
make test
echo or
game.exe
```
